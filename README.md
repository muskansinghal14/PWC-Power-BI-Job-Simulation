# PWC-Power-BI-Job-Simulation

## OVERVIEW

Completed my Power BI JOB SIMULATION of PWC Switzerland offered by Forage. Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, delivered valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis, and identified root causes for gender balance issues. 

## TASK 2: CALL CENTRE TRENDS

Created an interactive dashboard project using Power BI KPI on the "Call Center" as this is my task 2 for the PWC Virtual Case Internship.

With Power BI, I've transformed raw data into a visually stunning and interactive dashboard in a way that important aspects become very clear. Creating different types of customized visualizations using gauge charts, donut charts, stacked column charts, slicers, etcðŸ“ŠðŸ“‰
Also, I have used some DAX formulas hereðŸ“š

## TASK 3: CUSTOMER RETENTION 

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover some points.

On basis of the information provided by the retention manager, created an interactive dashboard project using Power BI KPI on the PWC virtual internship program (Task-3)ðŸ’»
With the help of Power BI, I have defined proper KPIs on customer retention, created a dashboard named "Churn Dashboard" that visualizes customer demographics and insights, and also created a "Customer risk analysis dashboard" which is an extension of the previous dashboard onlyðŸš€

ðŸŽ¯ KPI Mastery: Delved deep into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), sculpting a dashboard that unveils crucial metrics, providing a summary of a holistic view of performance.

ðŸ”„ Churn Dashboard: Crafted an insightful churn dashboard to decode customer behaviors, ensure retention strategies, etc. Customer loyalty is in focus! 

ðŸ“ˆ Customer Risk Analysis: Developed a robust dashboard for customer risk analysis, empowering strategic decision-making. 
Moreover, I used different DAX functions to create calculated measures and columns, refining the data for deeper insights.

## Task 4: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. Theyâ€™ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but theyâ€™re not seeing any progress. Theyâ€™re reaching out to us for help.
At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

number of men
number of women
number of leavers
% employees promoted (FY21)
% of women promoted
% of hires men
% of hires women
% turnover
Average performance rating: men
Average Performance rating: women


So, on the basis of these hints provided, I have created an interactive dashboard project using Power BI KPIs on "Diversity & Inclusion" as this is my 4th & last task of the Virtual internship on Power BI offered by Forage .ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
Throughout the task, my job was to define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover and create a visualization of the sameðŸ“‰ 

Diversity and Inclusion Dashboards: Created not one, but three impactful dashboards, each focusing on different facets of Diversity and Inclusion. Utilized the power of data to shed light on areas of improvement and successðŸ“Šâœ¨

What did I learn from this Internship Task? 

1. Data Understanding Process
2. Data cleaning
3. Finding Insights and Solutions
4. Data Uploading on Power BI
5. Data Modelling and Transform Data
6. Create Measures using Advanced DAX formulas
7. Made different charts like Line, Donut, Bar/Column, Clustered, Line, and combined chart
8. Uses of KPI Cards, Shapes, Slicers, Multi-Row Cards, etc.

## TASK 3: CUSTOMER RETENTION 

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover some points.

On basis of the information provided by the retention manager, created an interactive dashboard project using Power BI KPI on the PWC virtual internship program (Task-3)ðŸ’»
With the help of Power BI, I have defined proper KPIs on customer retention, created a dashboard named "Churn Dashboard" that visualizes customer demographics and insights, and also created a "Customer risk analysis dashboard" which is an extension of the previous dashboard onlyðŸš€

ðŸŽ¯ KPI Mastery: Delved deep into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), sculpting a dashboard that unveils crucial metrics, providing a summary of a holistic view of performance.

ðŸ”„ Churn Dashboard: Crafted an insightful churn dashboard to decode customer behaviors, ensure retention strategies, etc. Customer loyalty is in focus! 

ðŸ“ˆ Customer Risk Analysis: Developed a robust dashboard for customer risk analysis, empowering strategic decision-making. 
Moreover, I used different DAX functions to create calculated measures and columns, refining the data for deeper insights.
